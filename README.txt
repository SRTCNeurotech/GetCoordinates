Columns:
Centers_region - name of the scan area where the landmark is located (possible values: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g').
Center_x, Center_y - x and y coordinates of the center of this scan area in a stage coordinate system (in mm).
id_point - ID of this landmark (should be set based on your own considerations, values are accepted from 0 to 10).
X_work_st_px, Y_work_st_px - pixel coordinates x and y of the landmark on the 246 x 246 image obtained after processing (stabilization).
X_work_an, Y_work_an - anatomical x and y coordinates of the landmark relative to the bregma (in mm).
